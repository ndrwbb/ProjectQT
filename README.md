# ProjectQT

## Overview
This project aims to develop a program that can assist hotel managers by providing them with a convenient app that which lists all rooms and current bookings, gives an opportunity to search for specific rooms and their state, filter them and book.

## Project Relevance

In today's dynamic hospitality industry, **efficient hotel management** is critical for maintaining guest satisfaction and operational excellence. Streamlining the booking process and ensuring room availability significantly boosts hotel efficiency.

According to industry experts, effective room management significantly boosts hotel efficiency, reducing the **likelihood of overbookings or vacancies** and **enhancing guest satisfaction**. This underscores the importance of utilizing advanced technology in hotel operations.

By filtering rooms based on various criteria, such as occupancy, maintenance status or room type, hotel managers can ensure optimal room allocation and upkeep. Real-time bookings reduce manual errors and enhance the guest experience.

By integrating these features into a single app, we can transform hotel management, making it more efficient, responsive and guest-centric. 

## Implementation

### Visualization

- Utilize **Qt widgets** to create an intuitive interface for users to interact with the program.

### Data Fetching

- Create **two datasets** for rooms and bookings respectively.
- Develop a **C++ program** using Qt to fetch data from the datasets.

### Project Presentation

- Present the **functionalities of the Qt interface**, demonstrating how users can use app's features and visualize information.
- Explain the **process** of fetching datasets and their interaction with the app.
- Discuss any **challenges** faced during development process and what has been done to overcome them.
- Present **ideas** for future implementation and possible enhancement of the project for various needs.

## Requirements

- **C++ compiler**
- **Qt** for developing the application
